# Project Requirements 
The app was designed for a simple task helping teachers to create quiz. The main concept here is that students who are enrolled in the course can start giving a specific quiz provided by their teachers. Although, from teacher dashboard teachers are allowed to create and edit the book (teacher's dashboard is available to all user who create the account). In the future, the app will increase its functionality to create a timed quiz and shut down the created quiz after class.

# Challenges & Solutions
# Database Schema
The main goal was to make the database efficient and fast with interactive UI since everything was being built from scratch.

The solution was very simple, follow industry-standard methods to create wireframes and schema requirements to find loopholes before jumping into the development. 

# How it works
This web app lets users create/login in into the system with their own account. NodeJS does the magic for creating access token for logging users into the system and logging out using JWT. This app used non-relational databases NoSql. The interactive UI is created using AngularJS/Angular Material Design libraries and advanced HTML/CSS. ðŸ˜Ž
